### Procedure 

### Configuration:-
- Configure the Rc- column with Working load P, Grade of steel, Grade of concrete,  essentricity, applied bending moment and support condition.
- Next step calculate arbitary depth of neutral axis(Xu).
- Calculate strain in compression and tension steel.  click on next step
- Calculate stress in compression and tension steel 
- Observe the area of steel at compression and tension
- Enter the bar, diameter of lateral tie
