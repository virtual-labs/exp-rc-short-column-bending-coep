### Aim 
To design a reinforced concrete (RC) short column subjected to an axial load, ensuring that it can safely resist the applied load while meeting the required strength and serviceability criteria.

### Objective
-  Understand the principles and theories governing the design of RC short columns, including material properties, load combinations, and design codes.
-  Determine the required dimensions of the column cross-section.
-  Calculate the amount and arrangement of steel reinforcement needed.
-  Ensure the column meets strength and serviceability requirements for the applied axial load.
