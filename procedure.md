### Procedure 

### Configuration:-
- Enter the following design parameters:<br>
Working Load (P) in KN<br>
Eccentricity (e) in mm<br>
Size of column (b) and (D) in mm<br>
Effective cover (d<sup>’</sup>) in mm<br>
- Select the grade of concrete (f<sub>ck</sub>) and grade of steel (f<sub>y</sub>) in N/mm<sup>2</sup>.
- Click on ‘Check Configuration’ button and proceed to the next step.
 
### Calaculation:-
-	Calculate X<sub>ubal</sub> using the ratio of limiting depth of neutral axis to the effective depth.<br>
	X<sub>u</sub>/d (for Fe 250) = 0.53<br>
	X<sub>u</sub>/d (for Fe 415) = 0.48<br>
	X<sub>u</sub>/d(for Fe 500) = 0.46<br>
-	Click on submit and after three incorrect attempts the correct answer and formula will be displayed.
-	Calculate the strain in compression ($$\epsilon$$<sub>sc</sub>). After three incorrect attempts the correct formula and answer will be displayed.
-	Calculate the strain in tension steel ($$\epsilon$$<sub>st</sub>). After three incorrect attempts the correct formula and answer will be displayed.
-	Click on ‘Next Level’ to proceed to the next step.
-	Stresses in compression and tension are calculated. Click on ‘Next Level’ to proceed to the next step.
-	Tension and compression steel area is calculated. Click on ‘Next Level’ to proceed to the next step.
-	Enter the diameter of longitudinal bar to be used which should be greater than or equal to 12 mm as per IS 456:2000 Cl. 26.5.3.1 d.
-	Enter the number of bars and click on submit button.
-	Enter the diameter of lateral ties to be used. Lateral spacing of tie bars is displayed.
